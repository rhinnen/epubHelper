# TO DO
- Need to clean up code
	- Currently the code is broken into large tasks. With the addition of the image processing code, there are now two sections that write to the file. I find that messy.
	I need to consider if I want to do a first "collection" pass of the code, and then a second "process" pass of the code. The collection pass would collect all of the assets and store them. Process would write the files. I like that separation of function, seems like it could make it easier to troubleshoot.
- Make some of the processing easier to identify in the master html.
- Write up a use document, explaining how best to use the code.
